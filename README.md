# Project Management Tool

A project management tool app to track tasks within a project

## Overview

This is a student project to improve my skills with React, Next JS and Typescript as well as work with Test Driven Development. I chose this type of app as it will also improve my back-end skills and experience and offers a good set range of skills to be shown.

A project is created and tasks are created within this project. An epic (name subject to change) can be created to group a specific set of tasks within the project.

Task status can be updated and rendered correctly in the UI. There will be 2 views - a task view which shows the task for the project in their appropriate statuses and then in a timeline view - which will allow for a time period based visual overview

Demo coming soon!
